Jsp_login_interface
===================

This repo consist of my experimentation of the JSP and Servlet technologies. It is an login interface with two types of user: user, admin. The experimentation lead to an conclusion that programming web app in plain jsp and servlet requires significant amount of work. So for the large project it is better to use frameworks to realize it.
